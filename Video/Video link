I have executed one of the test suite collection for Data driven testing in the videi.
Similarly all the other test cases and suites and test suite collections have successfully been run and executed, which have been reported through reports.
Reports for each test suite and test suite collection have been generated under the Project --> Reports folder of this repository.
