I couldn't run and execute the test cases due to the screen recording software, but reports were generated for each test suit and test suit collection which have included each test case and each functionality.
I have uploaded the reports under the project --> Reports folder. These reports clearly indicate that I have successfuly been able to execute each test case without fail.
